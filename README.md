# Home Owners Association
This is a fully tested application for managing and maintaining HOAs. It is written in Java using Spring and Gradle.
It has 3 microservices.
1) User-Microservice -> Handles registration and authentication of users
2) HOA-Microservice -> The main microservice that handles every thing related to HOAs
3) Voting-Microservice -> This microservice handles voting specifically.

All the microservices have been tested thoroughly using various techniques like _unit testing, integration testing, boundary testing_ and _parameterized tests_.
It also has _system-level tests_ that was done manually using postman and that has been documented. The document for that can be found in the Documents directory.

The Document directory also contains other important documents. It contains documents for:
1) Assignment 1 Task 1
2) Assignment 1 Task 2
3) Sprint Retrospectives
4) User Requirements
5) Functional Testing
